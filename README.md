## Welcome to my "Investigate a Dataset" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Into to Data Analysis" course.  

In this course we learned how to do the following things:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

For this project, I used Python to investigate a dataset containing demographics and passenger information from passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

Both the original `.ipynb` file and the generated `.html` file can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!

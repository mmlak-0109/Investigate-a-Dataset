## Welcome to my "Investigate a Dataset" Project Page!

In this project, I used Python to investigate a dataset containing demographics and passenger information from passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

Both the original `.ipynb` file and the generated `.html` file can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!
